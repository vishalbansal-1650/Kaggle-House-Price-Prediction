# Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction

I have created this repositry as part of my kaggle journey by playing around with a dataset and trying to build a proper flow of various tasks used in a typical machine learning algorithms 

## Dataset Used : 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/data

or can also find the dataset here 
https://github.com/vishalbansal-1650/Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction/tree/main/Data

Here are the steps which i have performed in this notebook 

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
  ### 1. Univariate Analysis
  ### 2. Bivariate Analysis
  ### 3. Data Preprocesing steps
  ### 4. Feature Engineering
  ### 5. Model Building
       5.1 Train-test split
       5.2 Feature Scaling
       5.3 Ensemble Algorithms 
           A) Bagging
           B) AdaBoosting
           C) Random Forest
           D) Gradient Boosting
           E) XGBoost
           F) LightGBM
           G) CatBoost
       5.4 Blending
       
## Future Work:
A.) Will add weight optimization function for blending
<Br>B.) Use Feature Selection and train model on those selected features</Br>
